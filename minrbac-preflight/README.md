# minrbac-preflight


This app showcases a minimal example of using

- `requireMinimalRBACPrviliges` flag
- `exclude` filters on Preflight checks with `not IsKurl` as the condition


The product is an app that has the following properties

- Rich preflight checks of node resources can be run in an embedded kURL scenario
- End-to-end automatable installs in the minimal RBAC scenario where preflight checks would otherwise need to be run manually
